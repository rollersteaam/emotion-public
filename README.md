Emotion is in **Open Beta** phase at the moment and is happily accepting testers. If you join now, you'll get Emotion Supporter free forever.

**Emotion is the music player of music you feel.** Emotion is for the hard workers that need great music to focus to; the gym goers that need the energetic music that will make them run to the ends of the world and back, the venerated students that need the most inspiring music to go on despite all odds, and creative artists who want the music that opens their mind at the right time every time.

It gets all your songs from Spotify, YouTube and songs on your device all into one place and allows you to play music by its emotions. Think it could be good? Join the beta today and find out if it works for you.
